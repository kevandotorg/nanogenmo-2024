# nanogenmo-2024

This started as a book that jumped distractedly between different instructional texts, having to double-back and redo things.
When I realised that the "(see figure 47)" asides that I was working to filter out were actually much funnier left in, I focused on that
instead. The text jumps randomly between subjects while otherwise working through its source material, the figures and their
italicised pointers are inserted at pure random.
